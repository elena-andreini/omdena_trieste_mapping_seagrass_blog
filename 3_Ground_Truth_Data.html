<p>One of the primary challenges encountered in our project revolved around securing 
high-quality ground truth (GT) data for training purposes.</p> 
<p>Our strategy was to procure vector-based georeferenced data regarding seagrass 
habitats in the Mediterranean region. From there, our aim was to translate this 
spatial information into pixel-level data within our chosen satellite imagery.</p>
<p>Our objective was to conduct semantic segmentation on satellite imagery, which requires 
GT data in the form of image-mask pairs. Such masks classify each pixel by assigning 
it to predefined categories, including seagrass. We therefore looked out for datasets 
containing georeferenced polygons outlining complete seagrass patches within specific 
Mediterranean regions. These polygons, typically stored in formats like GeoJSON or 
shapefile, formed the basis of our segmentation task.This approach provided an adaptable 
framework for generating ground truth data, capable of accommodating various data formats 
and satellite imagery selections.</p>
<p>Initially, our search for seagrass data led us to  the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a> platform, 
where we expected to find readily available information in the form of presence/absence
 data. <strong>GBIF</strong> presence/absence data essentially consist of point coordinates indicating 
 areas where seagrass presence has been confirmed through various methodologies. 
 However, while abundant, the presence/absence data posed a significant imbalance issue,
being skewed towards confirming seagrass presence rather than absence. As a result,
we encountered a lack of comprehensive classification of seagrass/non-seagrass pixels 
in our target regions. This limitation hindered our ability to proceed with 
segmentation tasks, as we lacked reliable data on non-seagrass areas.</p>
<p>Therefore, we decided to focus on other data sources.
Large scale georeferenced data of seagrass extents in the Mediterranean is typically
provided by governmental or intergovernmental resources such as <strong>EMODnet</strong>, 
and <strong>UNEP-WCMC.</strong></p>
<p>These databases do not necessarily agree on the spatial extent of seagrass meadows, 
as the data they contain often come from different time points. Although these discrepancies 
were highlighted in research articles from 2016 and again in 2019, they remain unresolved.</p> 
<p>Additionally, some databases include datasets with incorrect georeferencing that have not 
been corrected. Retrieving metadata regarding the origin of the data from these databases 
can also be challenging for non-expert users. Our search for relevant datasets led us to contact
several authors of published studies. We meticulously assessed the datasets based on factors 
such as the date of collection, the accuracy of georeferencing, and the methodologies employed.</p>
<p>After this thorough evaluation, we decided to select two regions for our project due to the 
reliability and recency of their data. These datasets included a map of seagrass 
presence/absence in the Greek seas , published and openly accessible by a university 
consortium <a  href="#GreekDataset">[11]</a>, and a map of seagrass presence/absence in the Croatian sea, measured by 
Croatian governmental authorities and freely accessible online through a coding interface <a  href="#CroatiaDataset">[13]</a>.</p>
<p>Neither dataset included information about the presence of dead seagrass beds or the health 
(e.g., photosynthetic activity or density) of the seagrass beds.</p>
<p>We were aware of other georeferenced datasets of seagrass presence/absence in the Mediterranean 
Sea but excluded them for various reasons. These included seagrass beds in the Balearic Islands, 
Malta, Italy, and France.</p> 
<p>While the Balearic seagrass bed extents are well-documented and 
publicly available online, the provided files date back to 2008, and the actual extent of the 
seagrass beds may have changed since then. Although Malta recently mapped its seagrass bed extents,
 our request to download the corresponding shapefiles went unanswered for months.</p> 
 <p>The French and Italian seagrass extents are stored in publicly available databases, 
 but these often lack metadata on when and how the mapping was conducted. 
 Additionally, these databases do not agree on the extents, and there are indications that 
 some of the data are at least five years oldâ€”a period during which seagrass beds may have 
 undergone changes.</p>
