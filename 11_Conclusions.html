<p>In this work, we explore the use of Sentinel-2 multispectral images for remote detection and segmentation of seagrass beds in the Mediterranean. The generated model performs pixel-wise detection of seagrass beds, achieving a maximum segmentation efficiency of 41% in IoU scores, and accurately identifying land, seawater, and seagrass meadows.</p>
<p>To train the model, we created a dataset of approximately 500 high-resolution satellite images, each containing at least 5% seagrass bed pixels from the Greek and Croatian seas. This dataset was augmented to over 5000 images.</p>
<p>While the performance of our model is not state-of-the-art compared to similar architectures in the literature, we believe our project makes a significant contribution to the mapping of seagrass in the Mediterranean for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Open Source and Accessible Data</strong>: Both the satellite imagery and the ground truth data are freely available to everyone.</li>
    <li><strong>Public Code and Model</strong>: The code and model are publicly accessible.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparent and Usable Datasets</strong>: The datasets will be made public and documented with data cards to increase transparency and usability.</li>
    <li><strong>Use of Easily Available Information</strong>: Our model does not rely on additional information such as in situ measurements or accurate water depth data. This enhances its applicability in diverse scenarios where such information might not be available.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that the main limitations of our model stem from this lack of additional information. For instance, image corrections like sunglint removal and water column correction are applied in a simplified manner due to the absence of depth information, which would otherwise yield more accurate corrections. Additionally, deep water masking is not applied for the same reason.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while we originally downloaded a larger dataset, we needed to sanitize it manually to ensure the download process was correct and that there were no inconsistencies in the masks, which reduced the dataset size considerably. Also, using images averaged over time instead of just two images per period could potentially improve the model's performance.</p>
<p>We hope that our public project, despite its limitations, can be a valuable resource for further collaborative efforts aimed at mapping seagrass in the Mediterranean. By making every detail of our work transparent, including lessons learned, pros and cons, and providing the code for every step, we aim to facilitate and inspire future projects in this domain. Our commitment to open-source principles ensures that our data and methods are accessible and clear, fostering an environment where researchers and practitioners can build upon our work to advance the understanding and preservation of marine ecosystems.</p>
