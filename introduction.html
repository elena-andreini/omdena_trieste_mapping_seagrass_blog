<p>Globally, seagrasses cover approximately 160,000 kmÂ², encompassing 72 species, with seven found in the Mediterranean Sea. These marine seagrasses evolved from terrestrial plants around 70 million years ago, colonizing shallow coastal waters worldwide, with the exception of the Antarctic region.</p>
<p>Submarine seagrass meadows are crucial ecosystems for our oceans. They produce large amounts of oxygen, absorb significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and act as biodiversity hotspots by providing food and shelter for numerous species while protecting and nourishing our beaches. Unfortunately, these ecosystems face serious threat from human impacts.</p>
<p>In Europe alone, over a third of the seagrass area was lost from 1869 to 2016<a href="#DlSantos19">[2]</a>. However, recent trends demonstrate that it is possible to slow down and even reverse these declines, potentially restoring the ecosystem services they offer, underscoring the importance of seagrasses. Mitigating the loss of seagrass meadows is becoming increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>The <strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong> hosts various seagrass species, including Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa, Zostera marina, Nanozostera noltii (Zostera noltii), Halophila stipulacea, Halodule uninervis (found along Egyptian coasts), and Ruppia species in brackish lagoons.</p>
<p><strong>Posidonia oceanica</strong>, the most well-known and recognizable species, thrives in sandy, rocky, and coralligenous substrates up to 50 meters deep, typically found at depths of 20-30 meters. Its distinct features include long leaves, intricate meadows, and a characteristic rhizome structure called matte, which grows slowly, about 1 meter per century, and is crucial for sediment trapping. However, its health is sensitive to sedimentation rates.</p>
<p><strong>Cymodocea nodosa</strong>, the second most widespread species in the Mediterranean, prefers sandy substrates and sheltered areas, found abundantly in shallow waters and up to 40 meters deep. Unlike the genetically uniform Posidonia oceanica meadows, Cymodocea nodosa meadows are genetically diverse.</p>
<p><strong>Zostera marina</strong>, limited to the northern Adriatic and areas with freshwater influx, is a relict species with scattered populations. It thrives in brackish environments, where lower salinity protects it from parasitic fungi.</p>
<p><strong>Nanozostera noltii</strong>, once widespread in the Mediterranean, prefers fine-grained substrates in brackish or intertidal zones. It is currently declining, particularly in the Venetian lagoon.</p>
<p><strong>Halophila stipulacea</strong>, a Lessepsian species from the Red Sea, has established dense meadows along the eastern Mediterranean since the late 20th century, now also present in the western Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Posidonia oceanica meadows are considered a priority habitat under the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and serve as crucial bioindicators, reflecting the overall environmental quality more comprehensively than microbiological, chemical, or physical parameters.</p>
<p>Despite Posidonia oceanica being the most researched and significant seagrass species in the Mediterranean, mapping the location of its meadows across the basin remains a challenge, as available spatial data resources are infrequently updated. Moreover, because all seagrass species are photosynthetic, not all remote monitoring methods can distinguish between different seagrass species<a  href="#Abderrazak22">[16]</a>.For example, evidence suggests that Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images cannot be used to monitor the extent of individual seagrass species populations, as not all sensors can distinguish between the spectral differences in photosynthetic signatures of seagrass species.They can only potentially monitor the total extent of all seagrass populations.</p>
<p>The project aims to utilize satellite imagery and computer vision to map seagrass in the Mediterranean. <strong>Satellite imagery</strong> serves as a valuable tool for studying Earth's ecosystems. By analyzing reflectance data captured across various wavelength bands, it is possible to identify the unique spectral signatures of different surfaces. This allows for the landscape distribution mapping of materials like water, vegetation, soils, and urban areas. For instance, vegetation tends to absorb red light and reflect infrared, while water absorbs infrared light, appearing dark in infrared imagery. Our objective is to apply these principles to classify seagrass meadows within satellite imagery, leveraging distinct spectral characteristics to accurately identify and map these important marine habitats.</p>
