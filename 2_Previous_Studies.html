<p>The integration of remote sensing data with machine learning (ML) technologies presents a transformative 
opportunity to develop autonomous and scalable monitoring systems. 
However, the application of these systems to seagrass meadows remains 
challenging due to several limitations in current approaches. 
These include sparse satellite imagery, inadequate metrics for model 
evaluation, and insufficient ground truth data, resulting in 
proof-of-concept rather than operational solutions.</p>
<p>We attempted to contribute to solving those challenges by undertaking a 
project entirely based on freely available imagery and ground truth data.</p> 
<p>Our goal was to potentially cover different areas of the Mediterranean and 
make both our results and methodologies publicly accessible. 
We aimed to facilitate further exploration and collaboration in 
the field of seagrass monitoring and conservation.</p>

<p>Our literature review highlighted several frequently employed algorithms, 
such as <strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</strong>, <strong>Random Forests</strong>, 
<strong>gradient boosting models like LGBM</strong>, and <strong>segmentation models like UNet.</strong> 
These algorithms have significantly enhanced the accuracy and efficiency 
of mapping efforts, underscoring their importance in the field of marine 
ecosystem monitoring.</p>

<p>There have been numerous works based on the aforementioned 
architectures or proposing new models and variations.</p>

<p>For an example of usage of RF see  <a href="#Traganos19">[10]</a> .
The study utilized <strong>Google Earth Engine (GEE)</strong> to map the extent of Posidonia oceanica
seagrass across a bioregional scale covering 22 Mediterranean countries (56,783 km&sup2). 
It processed 279,186 <strong>Sentinel-2</strong> satellite images from 2015 to 2019 using the Random Forests (RF)
algorithm for classification. Training data included 62,928 annotated pixels representing
different benthic classes. Validation was done with 2,480 independent field-based points,
achieving an overall accuracy ranging from 64% to 79% depending on the region.
In a recent paper using UNet <a href="Unetpaper">[15]</a>,the authors trained
a model using high-resolution satellite images from the Apulian coastline to perform pixel-wise 
classification of land, seawater, and seagrass meadows. 
After training, it was evaluated on a separate set of test images, 
achieving highly promising classification results with an IoU score of 0.83.</p>
